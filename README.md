# Project-Architecture

Great! Here's an **advanced, in-depth explanation with C# examples** for each of the architecture and design pattern questions you asked, especially from a .NET enterprise development point of view.

---

### ✅ **1. Explain your project architecture**

**Example: E-Commerce Platform Using Microservices & Clean Architecture (Hexagonal)**

* **Architecture Style**: Microservices
* **Architecture Pattern**: Clean Architecture
* **Technology**: ASP.NET Core, Docker, Azure Kubernetes Service, Redis, RabbitMQ, MongoDB, SQL Server

**Layers**:

* **Domain Layer** – Entities, Value Objects, Domain Events
* **Application Layer** – UseCases, Interfaces, DTOs
* **Infrastructure Layer** – Implementations (EF Core, EmailService)
* **API Layer** – Controllers, Dependency Injection, Filters

```csharp
// Application Layer
public class CreateOrderUseCase {
    private readonly IOrderRepository _repo;
    public Task Execute(CreateOrderRequest request) => _repo.AddAsync(request.ToOrder());
}
```

---

### ✅ **2. Architecture Style vs Pattern vs Design Pattern**

| Type                 | Example                      | Description                              |
| -------------------- | ---------------------------- | ---------------------------------------- |
| Architecture Style   | Microservices, Monolith      | High-level layout of components          |
| Architecture Pattern | Clean, Hexagonal, Layered    | Solution template within an architecture |
| Design Pattern       | Singleton, Factory, Mediator | Reusable object-oriented solutions       |

---

### ✅ **3. What are design patterns?**

Reusable, battle-tested, and language-agnostic solutions to common software problems.

---

### ✅ **4. Types of Design Patterns**

1. **Creational** – Singleton, Factory, Abstract Factory, Builder
2. **Structural** – Adapter, Facade, Proxy, Decorator
3. **Behavioral** – Strategy, Observer, Command, Mediator

---

### ✅ **5. Which design pattern have you used in your project?**

* **Singleton** – Logging, Configuration
* **Factory** – Object creation via DI
* **Strategy** – Dynamic pricing
* **Repository** – Persistence abstraction
* **Observer** – Event-driven notifications

---

### ✅ **6. Singleton Pattern and Use**

Ensures **only one instance** exists and provides **global access**.

**Use case**: Logger, ConfigManager, CacheProvider

---

### ✅ **7. How did you implement Singleton Pattern?**

```csharp
public sealed class Logger {
    private static Logger _instance;
    private static readonly object _lock = new();
    private Logger() { }

    public static Logger Instance {
        get {
            if (_instance == null) {
                lock (_lock) {
                    if (_instance == null)
                        _instance = new Logger();
                }
            }
            return _instance;
        }
    }

    public void Log(string message) => Console.WriteLine(message);
}
```

---

### ✅ **8. Can we use Static class instead of private constructor?**

Yes, but:

* **Static class** = no interfaces, inheritance, or lazy instantiation
* **Singleton** = better for DI, interfaces, lazy loading, testing

---

### ✅ **9. Static vs Singleton**

| Feature       | Static       | Singleton        |
| ------------- | ------------ | ---------------- |
| Lifetime      | App domain   | Controlled, lazy |
| Instantiation | At app start | On first access  |
| Interfaceable | ❌            | ✅                |
| Testable      | ❌            | ✅ (with mocking) |

---

### ✅ **10. How did you implement thread safety in Singleton?**

Via `lock` or `Lazy<T>`.

---

### ✅ **11. What is double null check in Singleton?**

Prevents multiple threads from creating instance:

```csharp
if (_instance == null) {
    lock (_lock) {
        if (_instance == null) {
            _instance = new Singleton();
        }
    }
}
```

---

### ✅ **12. Can Singleton be simplified with Lazy keyword?**

Yes, `Lazy<T>` handles thread-safety & lazy init:

```csharp
public class ConfigManager {
    private static readonly Lazy<ConfigManager> _instance =
        new(() => new ConfigManager());

    public static ConfigManager Instance => _instance.Value;
}
```

---

### ✅ **13. Can we get rid of double null check code?**

Yes — use `Lazy<T>` as above or static constructor:

```csharp
static readonly Singleton _instance = new Singleton();
```

---

### ✅ **14. GUI Architecture Patterns**

* **MVC** – ASP.NET, Web Forms
* **MVP** – WinForms, legacy apps
* **MVVM** – WPF, Xamarin, MAUI

---

### ✅ **15. Separation of Concerns (SoC)**

Each component has **a single responsibility**.

Example in Clean Architecture:

* Controller: Handles HTTP
* Use Case: Business logic
* Repository: Data persistence

---

### ✅ **16. MVC Architecture Pattern**

* **Model** – Business data/logic
* **View** – UI layer
* **Controller** – Orchestrates Model + View

> ASP.NET MVC or Spring MVC

---

### ✅ **17. MVP Architecture Pattern**

* **Model** – Domain layer
* **View** – UI (interface only)
* **Presenter** – Handles UI logic, communicates between Model & View

Used in **WinForms**

---

### ✅ **18. Importance of Interface in MVP**

Allows **mocking views** during unit testing and makes presenter decoupled from concrete UI framework.

```csharp
public interface ILoginView {
    string Username { get; }
    string Password { get; }
    void ShowError(string message);
}
```

---

### ✅ **19. What is Passive View?**

A view that **has no logic**, just calls presenter — ideal for **testability**.

---

### ✅ **20. Explain MVVM Pattern**

Used in **XAML-based frameworks** (WPF, MAUI):

* **Model** – Domain logic
* **ViewModel** – Exposes data via `INotifyPropertyChanged`
* **View** – Data-bound XAML

---

### ✅ **21. MVP vs MVVM**

| Feature    | MVP                | MVVM                     |
| ---------- | ------------------ | ------------------------ |
| Binding    | Manual             | Data-binding (automatic) |
| Complexity | Moderate           | High (but scalable)      |
| Testing    | Presenter testable | ViewModel testable       |

---

### ✅ **22. What is a ViewModel?**

* An abstraction of the view.
* Holds presentation logic and binds via `INotifyPropertyChanged`.

---

### ✅ **23. When to use MVP / MVC / MVVM**

* **MVC** – Web applications (ASP.NET Core MVC)
* **MVP** – WinForms, WebForms
* **MVVM** – WPF, Xamarin, MAUI

---

### ✅ **24. MVC vs MVP vs MVVM**

| Pattern | View Type     | Binding          | Testable Logic |
| ------- | ------------- | ---------------- | -------------- |
| MVC     | Smart View    | Controller       | Controller     |
| MVP     | Passive View  | Presenter        | Presenter      |
| MVVM    | Bindable View | ViewModel (XAML) | ViewModel      |

---

### ✅ **25. Layered Architecture vs Tiered**

| Aspect  | Layered                         | Tiered                           |
| ------- | ------------------------------- | -------------------------------- |
| Focus   | Logical separation (code level) | Physical separation (deployment) |
| Example | Controller → Service → Repo     | Web Server → App Server → DB     |
| Layers  | 3/4-layers in same project      | Deployed on different machines   |

# Advanced

Below is a more advanced and in-depth explanation of architecture and design pattern-related questions with enterprise-level insight and practical examples in .NET.

---

### 1. **Explain your project architecture (Advanced)**

In a distributed, event-driven microservices-based e-commerce system, the architecture follows:

* **Style**: Microservices
* **Pattern**: Clean/Hexagonal (Ports and Adapters)
* **Technologies**: .NET 8, RabbitMQ, Redis, Kafka, GRPC, Docker, Kubernetes, Azure

**Bounded Contexts:**

* Identity
* Catalog
* Order
* Payment

Each microservice has:

* Application Layer: Use Cases, CQRS Commands/Queries
* Domain Layer: Entities, Aggregates, Domain Events
* Infrastructure Layer: EF Core, Cache, External APIs
* API Layer: Controllers, Middleware

**Cross-cutting concerns handled via:**

* API Gateway (YARP)
* Service Mesh (Istio)
* Distributed Tracing (OpenTelemetry)
* Circuit Breaker (Polly)

---

### 2. **Architecture Style vs Pattern vs Design Pattern**

| Type                 | Purpose                          | Scope            | Example                 |
| -------------------- | -------------------------------- | ---------------- | ----------------------- |
| Architecture Style   | High-level system structure      | System-wide      | Microservices, Monolith |
| Architecture Pattern | Implementation template of style | Module/Subsystem | Clean, Onion, Hexagonal |
| Design Pattern       | Code-level reusable solutions    | Class/Object     | Strategy, Singleton     |

---

### 3. **What are design patterns?**

Formalized best practices for solving common software design problems in a reusable and language-independent way.

---

### 4. **Types of Design Patterns**

* **Creational**: Singleton, Factory, Abstract Factory, Builder, Prototype
* **Structural**: Adapter, Bridge, Composite, Decorator, Facade, Proxy
* **Behavioral**: Chain of Responsibility, Command, Interpreter, Iterator, Mediator, Memento, Observer, State, Strategy, Template Method, Visitor

---

### 5. **Design Patterns used in the project**

* **Mediator** (CQRS with MediatR)
* **Strategy** (Payment processors: Razorpay, Stripe)
* **Decorator** (Adding logging/caching on repositories)
* **Factory** (Notification Service Factory)
* **Observer** (Domain Events using Mediator)
* **Unit of Work + Repository** (EF Core abstraction)

---

### 6. **Singleton Pattern and Use Case**

Singleton ensures a single instance and global access. Best for stateless components or shared resources.

Example: `ILogger`, `ConfigurationManager`, `TelemetryClient`

---

### 7. **Implementing Singleton (Thread-Safe)**

```csharp
public sealed class Logger {
    private static readonly Lazy<Logger> _instance = new(() => new Logger());
    public static Logger Instance => _instance.Value;
    private Logger() {}
    public void Log(string message) => Console.WriteLine(message);
}
```

---

### 8. **Can we use Static class instead of private constructor?**

Static classes can't implement interfaces, aren't lazily loaded or mockable. Singleton supports DI, testing, interfaces.

---

### 9. **Static vs Singleton Pattern**

| Static Class          | Singleton Class         |
| --------------------- | ----------------------- |
| No instance           | One instance            |
| Eager initialization  | Lazy or controlled init |
| Not mockable/testable | Mockable                |
| Can't use interfaces  | Implements interfaces   |

---

### 10. **Thread Safety in Singleton**

Handled via:

* `Lazy<T>` (Recommended)
* `lock` with double-checked locking
* Static constructor

---

### 11. **Double null check in Singleton**

Ensures thread-safe lazy initialization without overhead:

```csharp
if (_instance == null) {
    lock(_lock) {
        if (_instance == null)
            _instance = new Singleton();
    }
}
```

---

### 12. **Use of Lazy keyword in Singleton**

Avoids manual lock logic:

```csharp
private static readonly Lazy<Logger> _instance = new(() => new Logger());
```

---

### 13. **Can we remove double null check?**

Yes, prefer:

* `Lazy<T>`
* Static constructors (eager init)

---

### 14. **GUI Architecture Patterns**

* **MVC** – ASP.NET Core MVC
* **MVP** – WinForms, legacy
* **MVVM** – WPF, MAUI, Xamarin

---

### 15. **Separation of Concerns (SoC)**

Each layer/component has a single, isolated responsibility.

* Controller – Routing
* UseCase – Logic
* Repository – Persistence

---

### 16. **MVC Architecture Pattern**

* **Model**: Business layer
* **View**: UI layer
* **Controller**: Handles user input and updates model

---

### 17. **MVP Architecture Pattern**

* **View** – Interface, dumb
* **Presenter** – Handles logic, updates view
* **Model** – Domain

---

### 18. **Importance of Interface in MVP**

Allows mocking, testability. Presenter depends on abstractions, not concrete views.

---

### 19. **Passive View**

View has **no logic**, all behavior in Presenter.

---

### 20. **MVVM Architecture Pattern**

* **View** – XAML
* **ViewModel** – Implements `INotifyPropertyChanged`
* **Model** – Domain objects

---

### 21. **MVP vs MVVM**

* MVP: Manual binding
* MVVM: Data-binding
* MVP: Test presenter
* MVVM: Test ViewModel

---

### 22. **ViewModel**

Exposes observable properties to the view, handles logic, but not UI code.

---

### 23. **When to use MVP, MVC, MVVM**

* **MVC** – Web
* **MVP** – WinForms, testability needed
* **MVVM** – WPF, Xamarin, MAUI

---

### 24. **MVC vs MVP vs MVVM**

| Feature     | MVC      | MVP       | MVVM      |
| ----------- | -------- | --------- | --------- |
| Binding     | Manual   | Manual    | Automatic |
| Testability | Moderate | High      | High      |
| View Logic  | Mixed    | Presenter | ViewModel |
| UI          | Web      | WinForms  | XAML apps |

---

### 25. **Layered vs Tiered Architecture**

| Layered Architecture           | Tiered Architecture                 |
| ------------------------------ | ----------------------------------- |
| Logical separation of concerns | Physical deployment separation      |
| Controller → BLL → DAL         | Web Server → App Server → DB Server |
| Usually within one process     | Across multiple servers             |
